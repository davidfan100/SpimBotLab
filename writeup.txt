Pathing Algoirithm: Turn right, if time Shortest path algorithm that we learned in 225
Puzzle Solving: Implementing Rule 2

Main goal: Getting enough keys as fast as possible to access treasures
Find out which treasure is closest to the bot
We solve puzzles when we reach the treasure

We will only break a wall if the treasure chest is only separated by one wall. Even if we have no keys, we would still want to solve it
Optimizations: Checking other bot's position to see if it is worth it to go for the treasure
